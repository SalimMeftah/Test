So why not your favorite sweet?\n\nJust when we thought KitKat mania couldn't go any farther, Nestle opened a made-to-order chocolate shop this October at Namba Station, in the Chuo ward of Osaka, on Japan 's Honshu island.\n\nThe premium KitKat Chocolatory isn't just any chocolate shop that you would travel to see.\n\nInside, you can build the KitKat of your dreams and watch it harden before your eyes thanks to a blast of liquid nitrogen.\n\nPlace your order\n\nA row of personalized KitKats. Courtesy Nestle Japan\n\nLike a Willy Wonka Factory for KitKats, guests can use a touchscreen pad to make their dream candy, choosing from five types of chocolate for the base.\n\nThe chocolate options include basics such as milk chocolate alongside wild card flavors such as matcha or a strawberry-flavored white chocolate.\n\nRelated content 25 Japanese foods we love -- from tempura to miso\n\nThe nine toppings are marshmallow, pineapple, cranberry, mango, green raisin, almond, cashew, macadamia and shredded coconut. Each bar will set you back about US$6-9.\n\nCan't decide? Try the chef's selection, where the chocolatier suggests the perfect toppings to pair with your base chocolate of choice -- just like a wine pairing at a posh restaurant.\n\nNew York City has dozens of ice cream shops that are offering all kinds of crazy cold treats, from elastic ice cream to flash frozen sundaes.\n\nFor example, If you love matcha chocolate the chef might recommend marshmallow, cranberry and coconut as toppings.\n\nThere's even an ultra-luxe \"all topping\" version where you can try all nine garnishes on offer. That's the priciest possible menu item at \u00a52,050 ($18).\n\nYou're invited to \"Have a Break' and enjoy your KitKat in the store, but you can also pack them up as souvenirs.\n\nLiquid nitrogen certainly looks dramatic, but it has also become increasingly popular around the world as a way to \"flash-freeze\" ice cream on the spot -- and make cool Instagram videos at the same time.\n\nMore than 300 flavors\n\nIf Willy Wonka went to a train station, this is what might happen. Courtesy Nestle Japan\n\nOriginally introduced in 1935, KitKats are essentially chocolate-covered wafers.\n\nThough first launched in London by Rowntree's confectionery, they're now produced by Nestle, a Swiss company, in the UK and HB Reese Candy Company in the US.\n\nIn the US, one of KitKat's most successful jingles was \"Give Me a Break,\" with the sound of the two pieces of the bar breaking down the center to make it easier to eat.\n\nThese sweet treats made their way Japan in 2000, where the market ushered in quirky new variants.\n\nThere are now more than 300 varieties , including cheesecake, wasabi, green tea, sushi, and yuzu. The brand also collaborated with Sanrio on a special Hello Kitty KitKat collection in 2006.\n\nAnd Nestle intends to keep adding to its flavor roster: An all-natural pink KitKat made from \"ruby\" cocoa beans was released in 2018.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/kitkat-shop-osaka-japan/index.html", "published": "2018-11-02T00:11:04+00:00"}, {"title": "Where to find the world's best sake", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 \"No moon, no blossom. Just me drinking sake, totally alone.\"\n\nThis melancholy haiku was penned by Japanese poet Matsuo Basho in 1689, shortly before he set off on a 1,200-mile journey through Tohoku, Japan's vast northeast that reaches up to Hokkaido.\n\nThe trip is remembered in his celebrated travelog, \"The Narrow Road to the North,\" a classic of Japanese literature.\n\nA modern riff on the bard's journey might take in the region's hundreds of sake breweries -- many of which are producing some of the best sake in Japan\n\nWhether a sake tour will lead to inscribing timeless haikus is another matter.\n\nAward-winning sake\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThe Tohoku region, led by sake brewers from Fukushima Prefecture, has been piling up gold medals at the Annual Japan Sake Awards for a number of years.\n\n\"Tohoku has the highest reputation for sake in the country amongst people in the industry,\" says John Gauntner, a sake expert and author of numerous books on Japan's national drink, including \"Sake Confidential.\"\n\nAt the annual sake award ceremony, convened by Japan's National Research Institute of Brewing , hundreds of sake brands from breweries throughout Japan are rated and judged.\n\nFor 2018, judges awarded breweries from Tohoku's six prefectures a total of 69 gold medals out of a national total of 232 in 37 prefectures.\n\nMelinda Joe, a Tokyo-based journalist and a sake judge and panel member at the International Wine Challenge -- a separate sake-tasting competition -- says that sake from Tohoku is characterized for having a light, clean and elegant style.\n\n\"Tohoku sake has a little more voluptuousness -- a little more to give,\" says Joe.\n\nResearch work by the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association. Photo courtesy Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association\n\nPart of what makes Tohoku's sakes so different is geography: The winters are severe with heavy snowfalls and historically, because of its remoteness, agriculture has been the mainstay in Tohoku, explains Hiromi Iuchi, an official at the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association\n\nThe region has long produced huge quantities of sake, says Iuchi, but in the past few decades a shift has been underway to improve brewing techniques.\n\nRelated content Welcome to Sendai, beef tongue capital of the world\n\nThis has been led by an association of master brewers called the Nambu Toji, located around Tohoku's Iwate Prefecture.\n\nSuch is the influence of this group that toji (brewers) from western Japan are taking note of what their counterparts in Tohoku are doing, Iuchi adds.\n\nSake expert John Gauntner says the colder temperatures in Tohoku influence production and taste.\n\n\"Tohoku breweries have always had colder weather and so they can ferment, produce and store at lower temperatures which, among other things, gives the sake a very light, delicate, refined and elegant flavor profile compared to the rest of Japan.\"\n\nKenichi Ohashi, one of the foremost sake experts in the world as well as a co-chair of the International Wine Challenge, says sake from Tohoku is notable for its aromatic qualities.\n\n\"Personally I like a lot of the sake makers in Tohoku -- it's one of the things that makes Tohoku attractive for me.\"\n\nWhich bottles are the best?\n\nOhashi singles out Mutsu Hassen from Hachinohe Shuzo Sake Brewery in Aomori, a trophy winner at the 2016 International Wine Challenge.\n\n\"It has a good mid-palate weight, but is very perfumed,\" says Ohashi, while also praising the beautiful label, which incorporates images of the trawlers that plow the seas around Hachinohe at night fishing for squid.\n\nOne other sake Ohashi recommends is the award-winning Yamawa sake from Yamawa brewery. Although it sounds counterintuitive, Ohashi praises Yamawa's water-like qualities.\n\n\"Japanese people tend to pay a lot of money for the water-like taste, as with fugu (pufferfish).\n\n\"This sake is all about texture and not about umami -- it's a very pristine and transparent sake, it's like high-quality water.\"\n\nHow to experience your own sake safari\n\nFor visitors making the trip north, several breweries offer tours in English, as well as tasting, but you will need to book in advance via their websites.\n\nDaishichi Brewery , founded in 1752 in Fukushima, is unusual in that it still adheres to the kimoto method of brewing, a labor-intensive method that has largely been abandoned in favor of modern technology.\n\n\"The reason Daishichi has kept this kimoto method is that it leads to a certain type of sake,\" explains Ad Blankenstein, director of overseas sales and marketing at Daishichi.\n\n\"Sake which has body and a rich taste and, which in fact, is more like red wine than white wine and which can be paired with creamy dishes, with meat, French dishes ... food with stronger tastes.\"\n\nThe labor-intensive kimoto method practiced at Daishichi has been abandoned by many breweries. Photo courtesy Daishichi Brewery\n\nRemote Senkin Shuzo , a family-owned brewery in Iwate, has been making sake since 1854.\n\nYuri Yaegashi, one half of the current ninth-generation owners, recommends a brewery visit to the limestone-rich area in early summer or fall.\n\nWhile Ryusen Yaezakura is Senkin Shuzo's award-winning sake, Yaegashi also recommends Mori no Takara, made with matsutake mushrooms, a local delicacy grown in Iwaizumi.\n\n\"Matsutake are very special mushrooms for Japanese that evoke nostalgia,\" says Yaegashi. However, the aroma can be a little challenging.\n\n\"Some people said it smells like socks,\" adds Yaegashi.\n\nFurther north, Takashimizu Brewery in Akita also welcomes visitors.\n\nIts award-winning Takashimzu sake brewed at its Goshono brewery strikes a balance by offering both a gentle fragrance and a refined taste, according to Yukiko Takahashi of Takashimizu.\n\n\"It's the type of sake that can accompany almost any meal, owing to its delicate but refined character,\" Takahashi adds.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/japan-tohoku-best-sake/index.html", "published": "2016-06-21T01:49:34+00:00"}]}, "bbc": {"rss": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "link": "http://www.bbc.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46106086", "published": "2018-11-06T14:57:55", "title": "US mid-term elections 2018: Americans vote in 'poll of a lifetime'", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Polling stations opened at 06:00 (11:00 GMT) on the US East Coast\n\nAmericans are voting in nationwide elections that are being seen as a referendum on Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nPolling stations opened at 06:00 (11:00 GMT) on the East Coast, as Republicans and Democrats battle for control of the two houses of Congress.\n\nGovernor posts and seats in state legislatures are also up for grabs.\n\nThe mid-term elections come halfway through Mr Trump's four years in office and follow a divisive campaign.\n\nAll 50 states and Washington DC will go to the polls, and voter turnout is expected to be high.\n\nMr Trump attended three rallies on the final day of campaigning, telling his supporters: \"Everything we have achieved is at stake tomorrow.\"\n\nBarack Obama - on the campaign trail for the Democratic party - said \"the character of our country is on the ballot\".

So what?\"\n\nThe background\n\nThe UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016.\n\nSince then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data.\n\nFor its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to \"micro target\" voters.\n\nThe ICO said this had been the \"most complex data protection investigation\" it had ever carried out, with \"an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public\".\n\nIt said it had uncovered a \"disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy\".\n\nThe investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts.\n\nThe ICO said it had identified \"serious breaches of data protection principles\" and would have issued a \"substantial fine\" if the company had not already been in administration.\n\nThe report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum.\n\nIt said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a \"view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes\", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned.\n\nFines for Banks\n\nElsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance.\n\nBoth organisations face fines of \u00a360,000 for emails which breached data laws.\n\nThe ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent.\n\nIt also imposed a \u00a315,000 fine for a separate \"serious\" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database.\n\nA final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data.\n\nThe Vote Leave campaign\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Leave campaigners celebrate the referendum result in June 2016\n\nVote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ.\n\nThe ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws.\n\nIt said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had \"transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects\".\n\nBut it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered \"electronic marketing communications\" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules.\n\n\"We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,\" it added.\n\nRemain campaigners\n\nThe ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign.\n\nThis includes looking at \"the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker\", as well as \"inadequate third party consents\", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said.\n\nIt also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about \u00a3100,000.\n\nThis was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign.\n\n\"We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,\" the report added.\n\nDid this affect the referendum?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Remain lost the EU referendum by 51.9% to 48.1%\n\nThe ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be \"transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process\".\n\n\"We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,\" it said.\n\n\"But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.\"\n\nHow wide are the ICO's concerns?\n\nThe ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet.\n\nAlthough its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider.\n\nThe watchdog's report said all the UK's 11 major political parties were engaged in risky behaviour and it had sent each a formal warning.\n\nSpecifically, the ICO is worried about their use of third-party data brokers and analytics firms that pull in and process the public's personal information via a variety of sources without necessarily checking that consent has been properly obtained.\n\nIn addition, it believes that self-regulation by Facebook and other social media firms has not been consistent or rigorous enough and now believes a code of practice \"enshrined by law\" is required to govern the way their data and platforms are used.\n\nThe regulator also highlighted deep concerns about university researchers' handling of personal data.\n\nIt said that while measures were in place to try to make sure academics behaved ethically, the same could not be said for whether they had taken enough steps to protect the public's information - particularly in cases where the same academics also did work for private companies.\n\nAs a result, the ICO said it was now working with the higher education sector to make sure privacy rules are followed."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46103018", "published": "2018-11-06T13:07:10", "title": "Major home care provider future 'at risk'", "text": "Image copyright Science Photo Library\n\nVital home care services for the elderly and vulnerable could be disrupted, regulators say.\n\nThe Care Quality Commission has issued a notice saying it has serious doubts about the future of Allied Healthcare.\n\nThe CQC said it was concerned about its prospects from the end of this month, but the firm said the move was \"premature and unwarranted\".\n\nThe company provides services, such as help washing and dressing, to more than 13,000 people across the UK.\n\nThe CQC just has responsibility for England, where 9,300 people rely on Allied Healthcare services across 84 council areas, more than half the total.\n\nThe regulator has written to all the affected local authorities as they would have responsibility to step in if services are disrupted.\n\nFinancial difficulties\n\nAllied Healthcare announced earlier this year it was struggling with debts blaming low fees paid by councils, but it did manage to restructure its finances on that occasion.\n\nBut the CQC has now said the company had only be able to confirm it had funding in place until 30 November.\n\nThe regulator said it had a legal duty to warn councils that business failure was likely and services could stop as a result in its view.\n\nIt does not mean failure will definitely happen, just that as things stand it is deemed likely.\n\nThe BBC understands there has already been an offer made from a new lender that could secure the firm's immediate future.\n\nThis is the first time a notice like this has been issued to a whole provider -

We will see if the vote for governor breaks down in a similar way this time.\n\n\u201cMy congressional district is overwhelmingly Democratic and while I voted for Judy Chu (Democrat) there is no doubt about the outcome. Similarly, I voted for Gavin Newsom (Democrat) for governor but there is no doubt about this outcome either. More difficult were the propositions that California voters are being asked to render a judgement upon. I largely voted along with the progressive wing of the Democratic party with one exception \u2013 Proposition 6 (the gas tax). I voted for repeal because I dislike the regressive nature of the tax. It overwhelmingly impacts the poor and I would like California to find a different way to finance transportation related infrastructure. Most progressives will vote for the gas tax (so against Proposition 6) but I believe that the affordability crisis in California cannot be addressed without dealing with the gas tax.\n\n\u201cI am hoping that there is an overwhelming repudiation of Donald Trump. However, I expect that while the Democrats will pick up the House and make progress in a variety of state level races, that there will be no decisive check on Trump.\u201d\n\nA woman with her children votes at a polling station in Lorton, Virginia on 6 November.

There are three referenda on the ballot concerning hospital staffing, campaign finance and LGBTQ rights. Of course, Trump is the elephant in the room, but there are no strong Republican candidates on the ballot for any office, hence the concentration on local issues.\n\n\u201cI voted on the liberal \u2018positive\u2019 side of the three referenda on the ballot. I also voted for Elizabeth Warren to keep her in the Senate. I am undecided about whether I\u2019d support her for the presidency in 2020.

With biodiversity, it is not so clear but by the time you feel what is happening, it may be too late.\u201d\n\nThe loss of biodiversity is a silent killer. Cristiana Pa\u0219ca Palmer\n\nPa\u0219ca Palmer is executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity \u2013 the world body responsible for maintaining the natural life support systems on which humanity depends.\n\nIts members \u2013 195 states and the EU \u2013 will meet in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, this month to start discussions on a new framework for managing the world\u2019s ecosystems and wildlife. This will kick off two years of frenetic negotiations, which Pa\u0219ca Palmer hopes will culminate in an ambitious new global deal at the next conference in Beijing in 2020.\n\nConservationists are desperate for a biodiversity accord that will carry the same weight as the Paris climate agreement. But so far, this subject has received miserably little attention even though many scientists say it poses at least an equal threat to humanity.\n\nThe last two major biodiversity agreements \u2013 in 2002 and 2010 \u2013 have failed to stem the worst loss of life on Earth since the demise of the dinosaurs.\n\nEight years ago, under the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, nations promised to at least halve the loss of natural habitats, ensure sustainable fishing in all waters, and expand nature reserves from 10% to 17% of the world\u2019s land by 2020. But many nations have fallen behind, and those that have created more protected areas have done little to police them. \u201cPaper reserves\u201d can now be found from Brazil to China.\n\nThe issue is also low on the political agenda. Compared to climate summits, few heads of state attend biodiversity talks. Even before Donald Trump, the US refused to ratify the treaty and only sends an observer. Along with the Vatican, it is the only UN state not to participate.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cristiana Pa\u015fca Palmer, the UN\u2019s biodiversity chief. Photograph: Herman njoroge chege/IISD/ENB\n\nPa\u0219ca Palmer says there are glimmers of hope. Several species in Africa and Asia have recovered (though most are in decline) and forest cover in Asia has increased by 2.5% (though it has decreased elsewhere at a faster rate). Marine protected areas have also widened.\n\nBut overall, she says, the picture is worrying. The already high rates of biodiversity loss from habitat destruction, chemical pollution and invasive species will accelerate in the coming 30 years as a result of climate change and growing human populations. By 2050, Africa is expected to lose 50% of its birds and mammals, and Asian fisheries to completely collapse. The loss of plants and sea life will reduce the Earth\u2019s ability to absorb carbon, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nHumanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds Read more\n\n\u201cThe numbers are staggering,\u201d says the former Romanian environment minister. \u201cI hope we aren\u2019t the first species to document our own extinction.\u201d\n\nDespite the weak government response to such an existential threat, she said her optimism about what she called \u201cthe infrastructure of life\u201d was undimmed.\n\nOne cause for hope was a convergence of scientific concerns and growing interest from the business community. Last month, the UN\u2019s top climate and biodiversity institutions and scientists held their first joint meeting. They found that nature-based solutions \u2013 such as forest protection, tree planting, land restoration and soil management \u2013 could provide up to a third of the carbon absorption needed to keep global warming within the Paris agreement parameters. In future the two UN arms of climate and biodiversity should issue joint assessments. She also noted that although politics in some countries were moving in the wrong direction, there were also positive developments such as French president, Emmanuel Macron, recently being the first world leader to note that the climate issue cannot be solved without a halt in biodiversity loss. This will be on the agenda of the next G7 summit in France.\n\n\u201cThings are moving. There is a lot of goodwill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be aware of the dangers but not paralysed by inaction. It\u2019s still in our hands but the window for action is narrowing.

For spectators and participants, it marked an artistic rebirth in a city still trying to rebuild after the militant group\u2019s harrowing three-year rule.\n\nMosul, ruled by the Islamic State from 2014 to 2017, was the largest city under the group\u2019s control. Civilians were ruled by a strict religious code that called for harsh punishments; executions of men and women charged with crimes such as spying or adultery were routinely held in public squares. Then much of Mosul was destroyed during the Iraqi government\u2019s eight-month offensive to recapture the city, during which hundreds of thousands of civilians fled and thousands of others were killed.\n\nIt has been more than a year after since then-Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared Mosul liberated, but much of the city is still in ruins and struggling to find the funding to pick up the pieces. Organizers of last month\u2019s performance hoped the concert could help residents grapple with the trauma.\n\n\u201cThis city deserves culturally to be identified as somewhere where there should be music instead of the sound of bombs,\u201d said the concert\u2019s conductor, Karim Wasfi. Wasfi is the former conductor of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, whose Peace Through Art foundation helped put on the show.\n\nWasfi is known for bringing music to dark places. He drew international attention in 2015 when he played his cello atop some rubble in Baghdad where a car bomb had exploded the day before. Mourners and passersby sang along as he played Iraq\u2019s national anthem.\n\nThat performance came during a bleak time: The Islamic State still held control of major swaths of the country, and hundreds of civilians were killed each month by acts of terrorism and violence. The purpose of playing, Wasfi told The Washington Post at the time, was to reach \u201cout to people exactly where someone had experienced something so grotesque and ugly earlier.\u201d\n\n\n\nKarim Wasfi during a concert in Mosul, Iraq, on Oct. 27. (Ari Jalal/Reuters)\n\nWasfi\u2019s organization hoped to do the same in Mosul \u2014 and also perhaps draw attention from international donors who could help reconstruction efforts.\n\n\u201cThe government is depending on international support to rebuild Mosul,\u201d said Salih Elias, a local journalist who helped organize the show. \u201cA concert like this will send a positive message to the international world.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the city is drawing more cultural summits in the hopes of revitalization. This weekend, the annual Iraqi song festival took place at the University of Mosul, a choice made by the national government.\n\n\u201cWe insisted \u2026 to do the festival this year in Mosul to support this city because it\u2019s been through a lot, and to send a message to the whole world that Mosul is alive,\u201d said Asia Kamal, the deputy head of the Iraqi Artists Association, who spearheaded the festival.\n\nWasfi and his band of musicians will perform in Mosul again Saturday. This time, Elias said, the concert will take place in the more heavily damaged western half of the city, near a tall building where the Islamic State used to execute LGBT people by throwing them from the roof.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting their terror with life and music,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAfter car bombs explode, an Iraqi musician shows up with his cello\n\nAfter victory over ISIS, Mosul discovers the cost: Homes were turned into graves\n\nHow the people of Mosul lived through the war and the stories they told us along the way"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/could-brexit-bring-new-troubles-to-northern-ireland/2018/11/06/31adbb9e-d7a5-11e8-8384-bcc5492fef49_story.html", "published": "2018-11-06T15:09:51", "title": "Could Brexit bring new troubles to Northern Ireland?", "text": "\n\nMuch of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is imperceptible today.

As easy as the breeze, they crossed the largely invisible border into the Republic of Ireland, to visit family, or share a pint, or swim in the sea during the unseasonably warm weather.\n\n\u201cSo we all got to thinking how we take all this for granted \u2014 the freedom of it, the flow \u2014 and how it all could end,\u201d said Nicola Herron, 52, a local doctor who joined the group of like-minded women to pressure politicians to keep things just the way they are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, to be honest,\u201d said Elaine Doherty, 50, a psychologist and fellow activist in the campaign, which formally calls itself Derry Girls Against Borders. \u201cBrexit is just months away \u2014 and there\u2019s not a single person who can tell you what will happen to us.\u201d\n\nThe 310-mile border that cuts across the island of Ireland has become perhaps the single greatest impediment in the divorce negotiations between Britain and the European Union.\n\n\u201cA real sticking point,\u201d as British Prime Minister Theresa May put it.\n\nThe challenges loom over how to continue to allow for the free movement of people and trade between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which will leave along with the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd how to keep the border just as invisible, even as the U.K. and E.U. inexorably diverge \u2014 each free to establish their own immigration controls, customs tariffs, and food safety rules.\n\nAnd finally, how to do all this without upsetting the delicate peace in Northern Ireland that has relied upon an open border.\n\nPeople both north and south are quick to say there will be no returning to \u201cthe Troubles\u201d \u2014 the vicious, intimate guerrilla war between pro-British Protestant unionists and Irish Catholic republicans that left more than 3,500 people dead.\n\nYet, sectarian lines remain deeply drawn in Northern Ireland. Many people in this border city \u2014 still known as Londonderry by Protestant residents and Derry by the 75 percent with Irish Catholic heritage \u2014 worry that a bungled Brexit could rekindle tensions and possibly lead to violence.\n\n\n\nThe activist group Derry Girls Against Borders has been protesting a hard division after Brexit. (Charles McQuillan/Getty Images)\n\nToday, driving along the Irish border, you might pass a farmer who has a barn in one country but grazes his sheep in the other. Almost a million people freely cross the squiggly line on the map each month. There are 200 official crossing points, and nobody knows how many dirt roads, foot trails and cow paths. The economies are tightly intertwined.\n\nBorder checkpoints, and all the militarized infrastructure of barracks, watchtowers, bunkers and blast walls, were removed from the island of Ireland in the aftermath of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won pact that ended 30 years of violence. The agreement was in many ways a masterpiece of diplomacy \u2014 it didn\u2019t seek to resolve all political differences in Northern Ireland but instead acknowledged the \u201ccontinuing, and equally legitimate, political aspirations\u201d of both republicans and unionists.\n\nE.U. membership made such evasion possible. E.U. policies of free movement and free trade allowed Northern Irish republicans to feel more connected to the Republic of Ireland, while unionists could continue to be an integral part of the United Kingdom. No one had to choose. Lines, grievances, identities could begin to soften.\n\nBut after Brexit?\n\nRepublicans are anxious that a defined border on the island would undercut their relationship with the rest of Ireland. Leaders of Sinn Fein, the republican political party, have already warned that any Brexit border would hasten the day they seek an island-wide vote to unify.\n\nBritish loyalists are livid at the E.U. proposal to place a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. May\u2019s governing partners, Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, oppose any kind of \u201cspecial status\u201d that would make them separate from the United Kingdom.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has blamed the Brexit campaigners, \u201cwho are 100 percent responsible for bringing back the problem of the Irish border.\u201d\n\nIn the 2016 referendum, 56 percent of Northern Ireland voters cast their ballots to remain in the European Union. In Derry, it was 78 percent.\n\n\u201cBrexit has re-politicized everything,\u201d said Jennifer McKeever, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and owner of a shuttle bus service with a third of its staff and customers living across the border.\n\nMay and her European counterparts have promised there will never again be a hard border on the island of Ireland. But what\u2019s a real-world and politically feasible alternative? They haven\u2019t said, because they don\u2019t know.\n\nMay vows that her negotiators in the transition period after Brexit begins in March 2019 will craft an unprecedented free-trade accord with Europe that makes an Irish border unnecessary.\n\nFailing that, the prime minister says, Britain will deploy a new, not-yet-invented \u201ctechnological fix\u201d \u2014 perhaps a system that employs cameras with facial recognition software, plus mobile tracking apps and customs checks in warehouses far from the border.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s top police officer has warned that any customs posts or security installations would be viewed as \u201cfair game\u201d for attack.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we would want is any infrastructure around the border, because there is something symbolic about it and it becomes a target for violent dissident republicans,\u201d Chief Constable George Hamilton told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nPaddy Gallagher, 26, is a spokesman for a new fringe political party called Saoradh, which means \u201cliberation\u201d in Irish. The group is home to hard-line republicans who reject the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nGallagher concurred that \u201cany sign of a fixed border\u201d would quickly become a target.

Although the protests were dismissed by many as \u201crecreational rioting\u201d by drunken mobs, more than 70 petrol bombs were hurled, alongside two pipe bombs thrown at police officers.\n\nThis civil unrest occurred on the same streets that were the backdrop of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d when British soldiers shot and killed 14 unarmed protesters at a civil rights march in a Catholic neighborhood in 1972.\n\n\u201cIt was in Derry where the Troubles started, and it was in Derry where they ended, too,\u201d said Brenda Stevenson, 51, a former mayor here and the niece of the Irish leader John Hume, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 for his role in bringing an end to the conflict.\n\n\n\nCatholics mourn the people shot dead by the British army on \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in 1972.

Frustrated by British delays, the Europeans have insisted on a \u201cbackstop,\u201d a legally binding insurance policy, to preserve an Ireland without borders in the event that a free-trade deal eludes them. In that case, Northern Ireland would remain a member of the E.U. customs union until the issue is resolved \u2014 a proposal that May has, until now, rejected.\n\nAlong the Irish border, people worry that the British prime minister might abandon her commitment to open borders. They have good reason. Polling commissioned by the University of Edinburgh and Cardiff University found that 75 percent of English Tory voters would accept the collapse of the Northern Ireland peace process \u201cas the price of Brexit.\u201d\n\nBoth Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland feel they are not taken seriously. Both sides were flummoxed to learn that May\u2019s new secretary for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, was so ignorant of Irish politics that she confessed surprise in an interview that \u201cpeople who are nationalists don\u2019t vote for unionist parties and vice-versa.\u201d\n\nNor were they happy to hear former foreign secretary Boris Johnson say that a soft border in Ireland would be no different than the discreet cameras that record and later charge drivers congestion fees for vehicles entering central London.\n\nJeanette Warke, 74, founded the Cathedral Youth Club for children in Protestant Waterside in 1972 with her husband, David, now deceased. They were worried about kids joining paramilitary groups.\n\nWarke said she voted to leave Europe, although \u201cwe were not clear what Brexit was about.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cYou voted to \u2018leave\u2019 if you were Prod [Protestant] and \u2018remain\u2019 if you were Catholic was the way it seemed to me.\u201d\n\nIf there were another referendum today, Warke said, she would vote to stay in Europe. She\u2019s now worried, too, about tomorrow.\n\n\n\nA republican sign demands the exit of Britons from Northern Ireland.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\n\n\n(Tasnim News Agency/Reuters)\n\nLast week, with a cinematic flourish, President Trump foreshadowed his administration\u2019s latest punitive measures against Iran with a tweet echoing HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d \u201cSanctions are coming,\u201d it declared \u2014 much to the cable network\u2019s chagrin.\n\nOn Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin followed through, confirming that the United States was applying sanctions to vital parts of Iran\u2019s economy, including its energy and shipping sectors. They targeted more than 700 Iranian individuals, banks, aircraft and maritime vessels, all with the explicit goal of ultimately reducing Iran\u2019s oil exports to zero. Foreign companies and governments that seek to circumvent these measures risk being sanctioned themselves.\n\nFor the Trump administration, which unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year, it is the start of another campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on what it views as a rogue regime. Hawks in the White House and Trump\u2019s Cabinet believe the sanctions will change Iran\u2019s behavior in the region. They have embarked on this course with the enthusiastic support of Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchies, all of whom want to see Iran forced to scale back support for its proxies throughout the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble,\u201d Pompeo said on Monday.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s opponents argue the administration\u2019s strategy will punish ordinary Iranians while doing nothing to persuade their rulers. In the months since the White House pulled out of the nuclear accord, the Iranian economy has gone stagnant and its currency has tanked. Major multinational companies have either quit the country or extensively drawn down their operations out of fear of incurring U.S. penalties.\n\nThe International Crisis Group analyzed four decades of data on Iran\u2019s economic performance and found there was little correlation between its national-security policies and economic distress. \u201cThe Trump administration hopes that sanctions will force Iran to curb its regional activities. But data shows that outcome is uncertain as changes in Iran\u2019s wealth have had little impact on the direction or capabilities of its regional policy,\u201d the group noted in a report.\n\n\u201cLike much of Trump\u2019s foreign policy walking from Iran accord/piling on sanctions is great politics but not great policy,\u201d tweeted Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. diplomat, pointing to the vast difference between the administration\u2019s zeal to punish Iran and its willingness to accommodate North Korea. \u201cThe Iranian regime is a bad one; but only Trump can praise [North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un] \u2014 a true authoritarian and threatening nuclear power \u2014 and not see hypocrisy in his Iran policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s leadership highlighted its continued adherence to the terms of the nuclear deal and decried the \u201cillegality\u201d of American actions. The European governments that signed the pact have also rallied in its defense. \u201cOur collective resolve to complete this work is unwavering,\u201d said diplomats from the European Union, Britain, France and Germany in a joint statement. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who pushed for the deal after his election in 2014, vowed on Monday to \u201cproudly break the sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran is gaining ground in the region, and I don\u2019t see these sanctions as reversing that,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman, a top State Department official on Middle East issues during the Obama administration, to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn fact, the sanctions may help Iran\u2019s hard-liners more than anyone. Analysts contend that the Iranian regime itself is well-insulated from the economic turmoil, and that its powerful Revolutionary Guard \u2014 the organization that also runs much of Iran\u2019s \u201cmalign activities\u201d in countries like Iraq and Syria \u2014 won\u2019t let the sanctions change its posture elsewhere. Indeed, it may feel emboldened to assert itself all the more in defiance.\n\nAs the International Crisis Group pointed out, the sanctions \u201crisk empowering harder-line officials in the Islamic Republic and prompting them to lash out, exacerbating regional tensions.\u201d That\u2019s a fear shared by the U.S.\u2019s European allies, who see Rouhani cowed by hard-line forces within the regime that never wanted rapprochement with the West.\n\nIn a phone call with reporters last week, Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat who served three administrations, argued that the Obama administration had a far more extensive international coalition in place when it applied economic pressure on the Iranians a half-decade ago. That is not quite the case now, with the European Union exploring ways to shield European business with Iran from American censure \u2014 and Washington already issuing waivers to eight countries, including China and India, to carry on importing Iranian oil.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration had a broad international consensus and coalition that worked hand in hand to ensure there wouldn\u2019t be evasion of the sanctioned regime,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThe Iranians are highly skilled in finding ways to evade the sanctions regime and we are not going to have a large number of partners who are going to be as vigilant as they might have been.\u201d\n\nTrump, experts say, may still be hoping for a repeat of his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Iranians, though, have shown no interest in treating with this U.S. president and may be intent on bunkering down and waiting out his presidency.\n\n\u201cTehran played by the rules and the United States broke its promises,\u201d wrote John Glaser of the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cThey are not about to willingly pie themselves in the face again in response to new economic sanctions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ordinary Iranians will face the daily toll of sanctions: the shortages of life-saving medicines, the rising costs of basic goods, the steady degradation of the quality of their lives.\n\n\u201cToday, ordinary Iranians are struggling to answer the question of why sanctions are being re-imposed and why they must suffer,\u201d wrote Iran analyst Esfandyar Batmanghelidj. \u201cThe inevitability of this suffering, and its quotidian dimension, is what makes the U.S. financial war so pernicious.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

In these countries, that\u2019s a punishable offense.", "text": "For decades, the United States has had voting turnout much lower than in most other developed nations. Between 50 and 60 percent of Americans tend to show up for presidential elections, and turnout often falls below 40 percent in midterm votes. The last midterms in 2014 were marked by particularly low participation, with a turnout of only 36.7 percent.\n\nThere are some indications that this year\u2019s turnout will be higher, probably driven up by deepened polarization that tends to mobilize voters.\n\nBut it is still likely that nonvoters will once again outnumber voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium, Turkey and Australia have all had turnout rates of more than 80 percent in recent years. And while turnout can also be boosted by holding elections on weekends or automatically registering eligible voters, those three nations have something else in common: They have mandatory-voting laws.\n\nWhile mandatory-voting laws might be more symbolic in some nations, a lesson that is frequently echoed in all those countries is that higher turnouts also have a broader stimulating impact on political participation.\n\nAlthough Switzerland has no national legislation that forces citizens to vote, at least one region, or canton, requires residents to regularly head to the polls. Officials there say the law has resulted in more diverse and more active political debate, too.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of compulsory voting is that it is a gentle way of putting pressure on citizens to get more involved in political issues,\u201d senior regional official Stefan Bilger told Swiss public television during elections in 2014. And that\u2019s despite the fact that the canton\u2019s procedures are relatively lax compared to those in some other countries. If you are ill or out of town, you probably won\u2019t face a fine.\n\nIn Australia, meanwhile, not casting your ballot and refusing to pay a fine can land you in court.\n\nIn some of those nations, making voting a strictly enforced assignment rather than a right has historical origins. In Belgium and Australia, for example, requirements were introduced by parties weary of better-funded opponents that appeared more successful at mobilizing voters. Mandatory voting was a way to limit the influence of groups that may not represent the majority but were disproportionately well-organized.\n\nSimilar arguments led to the introduction of mandatory-voting laws in Latin America, where enforcement differs widely. Some nations enforce the laws by threatening civil servants with work bans or banking customers with transaction restrictions. In other places, punishments for failing to show up to vote exist only on paper.\n\nNot everyone is sad about that. \u201cOpponents of compulsory voting often contend that the country may be better off if those who are disinclined to vote are not pushed to participate in public affairs,\u201d University of Georgia researcher Shane P. Singh wrote in a recent analysis.\n\nAt least in Europe, the introduction of more compulsory-voting laws would probably benefit some political parties more than others. When ETH Zurich researchers examined the impact of compulsory voting in federal referendums, they were correct in anticipating a massive increase in participation \u2014 but with it also came more support for policies backed by left-wing candidates.\n\n\u201cThe increase in turnout resulted in a 20 percent increase in electoral support for leftist policy positions, most likely by mobilizing citizens at the bottom of the income distribution,\u201d the researchers concluded, based on historical data. (Overall, turnout increased by 30 percent.)\n\n\u201cAfter compulsory voting was abolished, increases in turnout and related forms [of] political participation both vanished immediately,\u201d they added.\n\nThe exact electoral impact may vary among nations, of course, as right-wing candidates may back positions often more associated with left-wing candidates, for instance. But the Swiss researchers' broader finding \u2014 that mandatory voting mobilizes groups of voters who would not otherwise cast their ballots \u2014 can be both exciting and disconcerting, depending on whom you support.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\n\u2018There should be music instead of the sound of bombs\u2019: How Mosul is using art to rebuild\n\nNigeria\u2019s army cited Trump\u2019s remarks to justify opening fire on protesters \u2014 then deleted the tweet\n\nFive arrests made after video mocking Grenfell Tower victims goes viral"}]}}}
